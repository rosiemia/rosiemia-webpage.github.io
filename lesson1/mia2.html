	<h1>Why do I love animals?</h1>
	<p>I feel like many people tend to forget that we are much less then all the animals combined, and if they had the power, they would definately attack us. Most of them deserve chances to be treated the right way, without viokence or inhumanity. Especially like dogs and cats, they have feeling just like any human, but can't express them. Research shows that animals experience emotion. And, children who are gentle and respectful to animals are more likely to be respectful and empathetic to humans. For these reasons, it's important that parents understand their involvement in teaching children to respect animals. Kindness and justice to animals is an essential part of human virtue. They deserved kindness because they are dumb and helpless and cannot plead their own cause. Animals are useful to us in one way or another. Cruelty to animals is often due to the thoughtlessness and lack of imagination.</p>
